# Advent of Code: A Decade of Challenges in Golang

## Introduction
Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! Here, I am embarking on an ambitious journey to solve all the puzzles from the past 10 years of **Advent of Code** using **Golang**. Advent of Code is an annual event with daily programming challenges released every December, and my goal is to tackle each of these challenges year by year, day by day.

## Why Advent of Code?
- I challenged myself with participating in the 2024 version, and had a blast completing it!
- I believe this will help me learn and practice my data structures and algorithms.

## Why Golang?
I chose **Golang** (or **Go**) because:
- It has a clean and concise syntax, which is ideal for solving puzzles efficiently.
- It offers excellent performance, which is crucial for handling computationally intensive problems.
- Its standard library is robust and well-suited for the type of tasks often encountered in Advent of Code.
- It helps me strengthen my expertise in a language I enjoy working with.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by **year** and **day**:

```
/advent-of-code
  |-- year_YYYY
       |-- day_XX
            |-- main.go         # Solution implementation
            |-- input.txt       # Input data for the puzzle
            |-- README.md       # Description of the problem and approach
```

### Example:
For Day 1 of 2021:
```
/advent-of-code
  |-- year_2021
       |-- day_01
            |-- main.go
            |-- input.txt
            |-- README.md
```

## Progress
I will keep this README updated with my progress as I solve puzzles year by year. Below is a summary of my current status:

| Year   | Days Completed |
|--------|----------------|
| 2015   | 0/25           |
| 2016   | 0/25           |
| 2017   | 0/25           |
| 2018   | 0/25           |
| 2019   | 0/25           |
| 2020   | 0/25           |
| 2021   | 0/25           |
| 2022   | 0/25           |
| 2023   | 0/25           |
| 2024   | 0/25           |

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pat-glitch/AdventofCode.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired year and day:
   ```bash
   cd AdventofCode/year_YYYY/day_XX
   ```

3. Run the solution:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## Contributions
This is a personal project, but Iâ€™m always open to feedback, suggestions, or alternative approaches. Feel free to fork the repository or create an issue if you spot something that can be improved!
